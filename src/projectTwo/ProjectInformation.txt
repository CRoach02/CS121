Goal of Project
    Simple bank account tracker using an array list nested into a hashmap that stores and reads information from a text file.

Project Information
    The bank records text file needs to be loaded outside the source directory.
    The file "Main.java" showcases all the functions in a direct manner.
    The "bankLoop.java" file adds a mini webpage like function to call the functions used in this project.
