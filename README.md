This project is a game that follows a rock, paper, scissors style. Two players are asked to select a character and then battle to see who will win in a best of a given amount of rounds.

## <a name="project-2"></a>Project 2
Project 2 is a program to create an example bank system. The idea of the project was to nest an arraylist into a hashmap. This would allow for information to be called easily from a key and limit space problems as hasmaps take up little space. All of the information is stored on a text file, [Bank Records](https://github.com/CRoach02/CS121/blob/CS121/bankRecords.txt).

## <a name="w1-4"></a>Weeks 1 - 4
The assignments for this set of weeks mainly cover the basics of coding and how to implement them in Java. Such topics were loops, scanners, declaring data types, and just getting the general feel of Java. 

Weekly Assignments
- [Week 1](https://github.com/CRoach02/CS121/tree/CS121/src/weekOne)
- [Week 2](https://github.com/CRoach02/CS121/tree/CS121/src/weekTwo)
- [Week 3](https://github.com/CRoach02/CS121/tree/CS121/src/weekThree)
- [Week 4](https://github.com/CRoach02/CS121/tree/CS121/src/weekFour)
## <a name="w5-7"></a>Weeks 5 - 7
Week 5's assignments consisted of working with files in terms of writing, reading, and appending text files. Week 6 developed many of the class functions used in project one. Encapsulation, overloaded functions, and calling methods from other classes are found here. Week 7 links to project one as this is what that time was spent on.

## <a name="w8-10"></a>Weeks 8 - 10
Week 8 does not have a link as the assignment for the week was a group assignment on paper about identifying classes from the structure of a given application, service, or website. Week 9 involved working with static functions, arrays, and multi-dimensional arrays. Week 10 covered arraylists, inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, and recursion.

## <a name="w11-13"></a>Weeks 11 - 13
Week 11 saw the introduction of Big O as well as two types of sorting algorithms: bubble and merge sort. Week 12's assignments used linear and binary search along with sets and iterators. Week 13 involved the use of generics, hashmaps, and linked lists.

## <a name="w14-17"></a>Weeks 14 - 17
Week 14's assignments were about stacks and queues. Week 15 introduced binary search trees along with date formats. Week 16 introduced JSON or XML depending on which version of the assignment one did (I used JSON), and project two was worked on during this week. Week 17 mainly consisted of creating this portfolio.
